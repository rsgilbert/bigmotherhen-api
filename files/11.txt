A gash of fresh air hit the Big Mother Hen the moment the farmer led her out. She had almost forgotten what fresh air, sun rays and a cold breeze felt like caressing through her feathers. She breathed out deeply not caring to remember at what point she’d started to hold her breathe. After the hell she’d been through, this was indeed paradise despite what she’d had to do to get there. 

The farmer still held her tightly and by the looks of it he was leading her towards the edge of the farm, to freedom, to her chicks so it didn’t make much sense when he suddenly stopped. The Big Mother Hen looked around in wonderment. There, right in front of the farmer was a big old stump with an axe dug into it. It was a rusty old axe with blood tickling down the axial. She looked down to the stump, it was all red.

“Blood!” she cooed out loudly. Her heart began to race as she grasped the picture before her eyes, started to see the pile of feathers just by the tree stump, the blood stained deep in to the ground, the bucket of steaming hot water, the heads, more like skulls and finally the axe. The axe that would be used to decapitate her as well. 

“This was no paradise,”she thought as she started to struggle against the farmer’s firm grip but by this time the farmer was already holding her down, nailing her helplessly to the tree stump with his boots and raising the axe above her head ready to put an end to the story of the Big Mother Hen.

The farmer raised the axe stretching out with all his might and brought the axe right next to the Big Mother Hen’s head. He then bent to look just behind the Big Mother Hen.

“Ooh my,” said he, “your one lucky fella.”
