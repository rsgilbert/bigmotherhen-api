She turned and twisted to free herself as the dark stranger started to race amidst the stormy weather but he held his grip on her. He ran like the wind, jumping over ditches and muddy ponds on his way. He ran over valleys and hills, through forests and thickets, over bridges and across rivers. Not once did he stop to catch his breath, not once did he stop to rest his feet and not once did he loosen his grip on the big mother hen.  

The night turned colder and the moon crept out from under the clouds. The storm turned into a slight drizzle and the blanket of the night began to fall away. Just as dawn was approaching the stranger slowed down and almost suddenly stopped right in front of a wooden door. He opened the squeaky wooden door and sent the big mother hen flying inside then quickly shut the door behind him.
