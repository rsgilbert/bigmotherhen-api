“We did it,” shouted the Big Mother Hen the moment she stepped outside. Skinny was at her side and the pigeon was flying right above them. She looked back at the barn, her old prison. The farmer was getting up. He was headed straight for them. “He’s coming, we’ve got to run,” she said as she prompted Skinny up and together they started to run towards the edge of the fence.

“This way,” said the pigeon as she led the way. Behind them they could see the farmer being joined by three other people and together they started to round up the birds, trapping them with big nets and throwing them back inside  the barn. The Big Mother Hen ran as fast as her legs could carry her with Skinny right behind her. They made it past the fence and headed right for the forest. They kept on running until Skinny suddenly collapsed. The Big Mother Hen stopped and ran up to Skinny to see what was wrong.
“I guess am not as strong as I used to be,” she said breathlessly.
“We can’t afford to stop,” said the pigeon landing right next to Skinny.” the farmer is right behind us.

“I can’t go on, my heart is weary,” Skinny said weakly and for the first time the Big Mother Hen started to see the weary lines around her eyes, the  drooping feathers and the dimness in her eyes.

“I can not leave you here,” she said.

“The farmer is coming,” the pigeon was now shouting her emphasis.

“We are only a step away from our freedom. You cannot give up now.’’

“He’s coming.”

“I think this is freedom enough for me. I have nothing to go back to but you do. Go home to your family. Go.”

‘Take care of her,” she said to the pigeon as she got up.

“Run straight ahead, follow the sun,” said the pigeon.

The Big Mother Hen started to run. The last thing she saw was the farmer picking up Skinny and the pigeon shooting for the sky. She could hear the echo of Skinny’s hashed voice as she urged her to run faster.
