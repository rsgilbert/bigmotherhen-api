“Tell me my dear,” said he “what is a shiny princess like you doing here among the common fowl.”

The Big Mother Hen bowed her head feeling suddenly shy and taking note of all the gazes from all the birds directed at her.

“I, king of this rotten old barn, say to you all, I have seen beauty for I have been to so many places. But today I see a beauty with none to compare,” said the king loudly to the barn fowl. “I hereby take this lovely beauty to be my queen. She’ll stand where I stand and eat where I eat.”

There was a moment of chaos as all the fowl were opposed to what the king had said. They spit and stamped their feet in disagreement.

“Silence,” shouted the king. “Who dares question my rule. Let him step up and face his doom.”

The noise quickly died down in unspoken surrender. The king took the Big Mother Hen by her wing and led her to walk right in front of him to the troughs.
