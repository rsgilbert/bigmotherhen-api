The room was now bright and she could see that she was in a big barn. Its floor was covered in chicken dropping that had was so thick you couldn’t begin to scratch through it. It had a low ceiling, one door and one big old caged window from which you could see the sun come up but never go down. At the end of the barn, the crowd was growing, all the birds seemed to be huddled around what seemed like… a human, a skinny boy with a back bent towards what seemed to be troughs. He was putting food in the troughs while all the birds struggled to get first peck. The farmer finished with his work, made his way to the door kicking the hens in his way aside. He exited and shut the door behind him leaving the birds still fighting among themselves for the few grains of food.

The Big Mother Hen was still watching from his spot when she heard a loud shuttering noise behind her. She quickly spun around and found herself staring at the biggest cock she had ever seen. His feathers were a fiery red, and he had a comb that covered almost half his face. The dust rose high in the air as he got up from the corner he had been resting in. He yawned loudly, stretched his feet behind him, flapped his wings and gave the loudest crooooak!
