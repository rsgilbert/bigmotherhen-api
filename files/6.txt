The life seemed to drain out of her face, what about her little ones, yellow, brownie and the whole bunch of them, and Kiki who was so little, would she get to see any of them again, had they even survived the night, she wondered. She looked backed at the end of the barn. The king, Argo was gladly eating away at the food. All the other animals stood back and watched him with salivating mouths, swallowing every time he swallowed and wishing every time he pulled his head out of the trough that he was done and each time, they were disappointed. It seemed like Argo would never get full. He pecked and pecked, gave a big fat burp, then pecked some more and all the while the rest the fowl greedily and hungrily watched. 

The days at the barn were long and hush, but the nights were even worse. The birds not only fought for food but also fought for space, water, a dry place to sleep and they pecked away at one another eating the feathers off each other’s skins. The nights were too cold, and the days too hot. Each night the Big Mother Hen went to sleep, and each night she woke up screaming. Every time she closed her eyes, she’d see the dark stranger on that fateful night; she would hear the screams of her chicks, wings reaching out but never touching. The only difference was that this time the stranger did not grab her, he grabbed her little ones. She found herself reciting their names to herself more for reassurance than remembrance. And every day the farmer came in, she watched the door, thinking about how easy it could have been to just walk out.
