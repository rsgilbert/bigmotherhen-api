The noise in the barn stopped suddenly and the whole barn seemed to freeze over.

“Who is that?’’ the Big Mother Hen asked more to herself than to any one in particular.

“That is ‘Argo’, King for now and no later” replied  a skinny hen at her side she hadn’t yet noticed.

“Kings?” asked the Big Mother Hen.

“Yes, kings in a barn. There have been a whole bunch of them before him. They eat as much as they want, drink all the water and lie around all day while the turkeys fun the heat off them. And at the end of their regime, the farmer rewards them with paradise, “Said Skinny in her shriveling voice.

“What is paradise?” Asked the Big Mother Hen.

“Well I’ll tell you what paradise is,” she said, “it’s freedom, and happiness. You get to see the sun set again, bathe in dust, eat worms and breathe fresh air. The worms,  I miss  worms.”

“Hey!” The Big Mother Hen called to Skinny who seemed to be drifting into some kind of trance.

“Ooh! I am sorry, paradise. Sweet sweet paradise is out through those doors. But you have to be king first.” 

“Can’t you just walk out, like when the farmer comes in,”

“Walk out; you’d think no one has thought about that, wouldn’t you. You think we are dumb sitting ducks with a sealed fate. Look around friend, the only way you're leaving this place is with the farmer’s guiding hand when you are done being king which for your case is never, so sit back and enjoy the ride.”
