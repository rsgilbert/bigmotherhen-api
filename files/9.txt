Life at the barn became bearable. The Big Mother Hen was treated like the queen that she was. She had servants at her beckoning. The turkey fanned her during the day to keep the heat off her and the guinea fowl picked the dirt out of her feet. And best of all she had the pigeon ordered by the king to paint her face on the ragged ceiling where the history of the pen had been written by kings that ruled before. The pigeon was the only bird in the barn that could fly. Why she never flew away, no one knew. 

“On this wall are all the great birds that have passed through this barn” said the pigeon, “this here is our history and you my lady get to be a part of it. As you can see, you’re the second lady to have your face upon the wall.”

“I see you’ve gotten yourself to the big wall,” the Big Mother Hen turned around to see Skinny walking toward her. “Sneaky as usual. Just be careful as you tread.”

“Who is the other hen,” asked the Big Mother Hen.

“Ooh her, she was a queen.” replied Skinny. “The only queen this barn ever had. She ruled like no other. White queen they called her because she had the whitest feathers any one had ever seen.” 

“What happened to her? Did she go to paradise?” Asked the Big Mother Hen.

“No one really knows, some say she become mad, others say she did go to paradise, for a few seconds, then came back totally changed.”

“You’re the oldest here, you must know, what did happen to her?”

“I’d like to think that she found peace and freedom.”
