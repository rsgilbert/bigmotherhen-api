The Big Mother Hen was momentarily blinded and she remained glued to the spot he had landed. A gash of stinking rotten air hit her hard on the face and as the darkness lifted from her eyes, she started to look around and realised that if such a place as hell existed , then this was it. She could hear the sound of feet, of maybe a hundred or so creatures approaching her. Their faces were partly illuminated given the darkness in the barn. They were approaching from the dark, slowly closing in around the Big Mother Hen from all sides. The earth seemed to spin around the Big Mother Hen as she turned her head this way and that way to try and keep up with what was happening around her. 

The darkness was falling away behind them, their features starting to become clear. Fear was quickly building up in the big mother henâ€™s chest and she could literally hear the sound of her heart beating. She threw a wing over her eyes as the radius zeroed down. 

Bang! A momentarily second of quietness and then chaos. The Big Mother Hen opened her eyes and to her surprise the creatures all seemed to be running away from her or past her. And they were not just creatures, they were hens, cocks, ducks and she was pretty sure she saw a turkey.
